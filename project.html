            <h2>Give Clothes & Food, Spread Hope</h2>

            <p>Donating food and clothes is one of the simplest yet most powerful ways to make a difference in someone’s life. A small act of sharing what we have can bring comfort, warmth, and hope to those in need. By giving surplus food, we help fight hunger and reduce waste, while donating clothes provides dignity and protection to people facing hardship. Together, these acts of kindness build a more caring and compassionate community.</p>
